#assignment 2
#1.operands, an expression
#2)	Write a program to print the quotient when 9 is divided by 2.
#print(9//2)

#3)	Write a program to print the remainder when 22 is divided by 3.
#print(22%3)

#4)	Write a program to create two variables, store an integer value in them and run the arithmetic operations on them. Print the answers.
# a=4
# b=8
# print(a+b)

# 5)Write a program to create two variables, store an integer value in them and run the comparison/relational operations on them. Print the answers.
# a=5
# b=8
# if a<b:
#     print('true')

# Q6) is it suppose to solve with logical operators or anything else. I am bit a confused
# 7)	Write a program to create two variables. Assign any value to them using assig operator. Once the values are assigned perform the assignment operations on them.
# a=8
# b=4
# a+=10
# b*=5
# print(a,b)
# 8)	How can one check if 10 is greater than 0 and less than 20? Write a program for the same.
# a=10
# if a>0 and a<20:
#     print('true')
